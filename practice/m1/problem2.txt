The 4 different algorithms used to access the array are quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, weigthed quick union with path compression.
The best algorithm is weighted quick union with path compression, because the time complexity to solve the problem is very less when compared with the other algorithms. It takes about 6 seconds to execute.
N+Mlog*N. N is the number of objects and M is the number of operations.
the union-find cost can be calculated more effectively.
